  <h3>rCharts and d3-grid</h3>
  An early experiment with [d3-grid](https://github.com/interactivethings/d3-grid) motivated by [Herr Stucki](http://bl.ocks.org/herrstucki).  I would like to make some of the d3-grid capabilities available through rCharts primarily for use in small multiples or lattice-like strips.  Since I am having trouble deciding what to provide with an rCharts implementation, I wanted to replicate each of Stucki's three examples.  But before that, I wanted to just draw a table like layout with each of the cells colored based on their location.<br/><br/>

  <div class = "span5 main">
```{r results="asis", error = F, message = F, warning = F, cache = FALSE}
  require(rCharts)

  grid1 <- rCharts$new()
  grid1$field(
    "lib",
    "libraries/widgets/d3grid"
  )

  grid1$set(
    height = 500,
    width = 960,
    container = ".rChart",
    size = 400,
    nrow = 8,
    ncol = 8,
    bands = TRUE,
    data = 1:64
  )
  grid1$print()
```
<script>
  var color = d3.scale.linear()
    .domain([0, 32, 63])
    .range(["red", "lightgray", "green"]);
  cells.selectAll("rect")
    .data(function(d) {return d.value})
      .enter().append("rect")
        .attr("width", grid.nodeSize()[0])
        .attr("height", grid.nodeSize()[1])
        .style("fill", function(d) {return color(d)});
